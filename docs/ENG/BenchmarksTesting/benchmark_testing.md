## Benchmark testing

I have tested in these programs:

* [Geekbench v4.4.1](http://www.geekbench.com/)

During testing, all programs except the benchmark program (and the Finder) were closed and completed. During testing, the laptop was standing on the table and nothing was blocking the flow of warm air from the cooler.

The testing was carried out in macOS Mojave 10.14.6 Build 18G84.
