Kexts (kernel extensions) is a Windows driver. In this list, all the kexts are important and all of them are in `/CLOVER/kexts/Other`.

Naturally for each configuration of the computer you need a set of kexts and not only affect the performance of the system kexts, but also a variety of patches in the config, DSDT, etc.
