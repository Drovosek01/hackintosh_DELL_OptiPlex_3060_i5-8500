### Hackintosh programs

These programs are mainly used to configure Hackintosh, as a working MacOS tool, they are unlikely to be useful to you. Some of these programs, it is desirable to leave in your hackintosh in case something goes wrong and the system starts to "show off", because not everyone can determine how well and how fully configured your hackintosh.

I sorted the programs in order of importance. First come the most important, in my opinion, the program, and then less important. Also in sub-paragraphs I'll point out an alternative program.
